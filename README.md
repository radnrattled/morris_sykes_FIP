##Megan and Claire POO-PERONI FIP

#Welcome to POO-PERONI. This mash-up was born out of the mind blowing realization that beer drinkers, you guessed it, spend a lot of time in the bathroom. Many actually bring their beers with them because hey, time is money and we donâ€™t judge (as long as you wash your hands). Coined as the bathroom beer because you should be able to pop the top,while you break the seal.
